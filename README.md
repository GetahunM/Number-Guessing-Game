Number Guessing Game
====================

This is a simple number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the game gives helpful feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed or the attempts run out.
